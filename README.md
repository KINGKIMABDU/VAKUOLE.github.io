## 🧬 Project Overview
This site was developed as a biology school project. It features a real-time 3D-style simulation of a plant cell, focusing on how the vacuole regulates turgor pressure and stores essential molecules.

### Key Features:
* **Real-time Simulation:** A custom HTML5 Canvas engine that demonstrates ion transport and osmosis.
* **Interactive Controls:** Users can rotate, zoom, and trigger different simulation phases.
* **Comprehensive Content:** Detailed sections on structure (Tonoplast), function, types of vacuoles, and a comparison between plant and animal cells.
* **Responsive Design:** Optimized for desktop and mobile devices, including high-resolution tablets like the iPad Air M3.

## 💻 Technical Stack
* **Language:** HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript.
* **Graphics:** 2D Canvas API with a custom 3D projection engine.
* **Hosting:** GitHub Pages.

*Created for the 10th Grade Biology Curriculum at Gymnasium Georgianum.*
